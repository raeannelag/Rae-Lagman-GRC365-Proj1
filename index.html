                    <h3>SZA by Chappell Roan | MUSIC</h3>
                    <p>SZA has a lot on her mind—heartache, power, alienation, desire, revenge, god, water, sex, death,
                        legacy. Across two flawless albums, Ctrl and SOS, the New Jersey native has built one of pop’s
                        most devoted fan bases, casting spells with uncensored songs that cut as deep as the ocean that
                        inspires so much of her work. Before hitting the road with Kendrick Lamar on the Grand National
                        Tour, she got on the line with Chappell Roan, a kindred spirit in search of the method behind
                        her magic.</p>

                            how did he get here? His Him costar, the rapper Tierra Whack, came with the questions.</p>

                        <p>Rico Nasty holds nothing back—a trait that’s earned her a rep as a rage rap pioneer. Now,

                        <p>Frankie Grande has been through a lot: online rumor mills, a stint in the Big Brother house,
                            and
                            struggles with addiction. Now, at 42 years old, the former theater kid is taking those
                            experiences and pouring them into Hotel Rock Bottom, a pop debut that provides a
                            painful-yet-playful look at his past and has his sister Ariana bursting into tears–and song.
